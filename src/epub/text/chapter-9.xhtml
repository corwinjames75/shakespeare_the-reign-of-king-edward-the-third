			<p id="id00424">King John.<br/> Oh, Lorrain, say, what mean our men to fly?<br/> Our number is far greater than our foes.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00425">Lorrain.<br/> The garrison of Genoaes, my Lord,<br/> That came from Paris weary with their march,<br/> Grudging to be so suddenly imployd,<br/> No sooner in the forefront took their place,<br/> But, straight retiring, so dismayed the rest,<br/> As likewise they betook themselves to flight,<br/> In which, for haste to make a safe escape,<br/> More in the clustering throng are pressed to death,<br/> Than by the enemy, a thousand fold.<br/></p>
			<p id="id00426">King John.<br/> O hapless fortune! Let us yet assay,<br/> If we can counsel some of them to stay.<br/></p>
