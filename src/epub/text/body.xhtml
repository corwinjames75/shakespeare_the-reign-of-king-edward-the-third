Robert of Artois, banished though thou be<br/>

&gt;From France, thy native Country, yet with us<br/>

Thou shalt retain as great a Seigniorie:<br/>

For we create thee Earl of Richmond here.<br/>

And now go forwards with our pedigree:<br/>

Who next succeeded Phillip le Bew?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00065">ARTOIS.<br/>

Three sons of his, which all successfully<br/>

Did sit upon their father's regal Throne,<br/>

Yet died, and left no issue of their loins.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00066">KING EDWARD.<br/>

But was my mother sister unto those?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00067">ARTOIS.<br/>

She was, my Lord; and only Isabel<br/>

Was all the daughters that this Phillip had,<br/>

Whom afterward your father took to wife;<br/>

And from the fragrant garden of her womb<br/>

Your gracious self, the flower of Europe's hope,<br/>

Derived is inheritor to France.<br/>

But note the rancor of rebellious minds:<br/>

When thus the lineage of le Bew was out,<br/>

The French obscured your mother's Privilege,<br/>

And, though she were the next of blood, proclaimed<br/>

John, of the house of Valois, now their king:<br/>

The reason was, they say, the Realm of France,<br/>

Replete with Princes of great parentage,<br/>

Ought not admit a governor to rule,<br/>

Except he be descended of the male;<br/>

And that's the special ground of their contempt,<br/>

Wherewith they study to exclude your grace:<br/>

But they shall find that forged ground of theirs<br/>

To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand.<br/>

Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing,<br/>

That I, a French man, should discover this;<br/>

But heaven I call to record of my vows:<br/>

It is not hate nor any private wrong,<br/>

But love unto my country and the right,<br/>

Provokes my tongue, thus lavish in report.<br/>

You are the lineal watchman of our peace,<br/>

And John of Valois indirectly climbs;<br/>

What then should subjects but embrace their King?<br/>

Ah, where in may our duty more be seen,<br/>

Than striving to rebate a tyrant's pride<br/>

And place the true shepherd of our commonwealth?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00068">KING EDWARD.<br/>

This counsel, Artois, like to fruitful showers,<br/>

Hath added growth unto my dignity;<br/>

And, by the fiery vigor of thy words,<br/>

Hot courage is engendered in my breast,<br/>

Which heretofore was raked in ignorance,<br/>

But now doth mount with golden wings of fame,<br/>

And will approve fair Isabel's descent,<br/>

The most renowned prince, King John of France,<br/>

Doth greet thee, Edward, and by me commands,<br/>

That, for so much as by his liberal gift<br/>

Thou do him lowly homage for the same.<br/>

No sooner minded to prepare for France,<br/>

But straight I am invited,—nay, with threats,<br/>

Upon a penalty, enjoined to come:<br/>

Twere but a childish part to say him nay.—<br/>

Lorrain, return this answer to thy Lord:<br/>

I mean to visit him as he requests;<br/>

But how? not servilely disposed to bend,<br/>

But like a conqueror to make him bow.<br/>

His lame unpolished shifts are come to light;<br/>

And truth hath pulled the vizard from his face,<br/>

That set a gloss upon his arrogance.<br/>

Dare he command a fealty in me?<br/>

Tell him, the Crown that he usurps, is mine,<br/>

And where he sets his foot, he ought to kneel.<br/>

Tis not a petty Dukedom that I claim,<br/>

But all the whole Dominions of the Realm;<br/>

Which if with grudging he refuse to yield,<br/>

I'll take away those borrowed plumes of his,<br/>

And send him naked to the wilderness.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00078">LORRAIN.<br/>

Then, Edward, here, in spite of all thy Lords,<br/>

I do pronounce defiance to thy face.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00079">PRINCE EDWARD.<br/>

Even to the bottom of thy master's throat.<br/>

And, be it spoke with reverence of the King,<br/>

My gracious father, and these other Lords,<br/>

I hold thy message but as scurrilous,<br/>

And him that sent thee, like the lazy drone,<br/>

Crept up by stealth unto the Eagle's nest;<br/>

&gt;From whence we'll shake him with so rough a storm,<br/>

I might perceive his eye in her eye lost,<br/>

His ear to drink her sweet tongue's utterance,<br/>

And changing passion, like inconstant clouds<br/>

That rack upon the carriage of the winds,<br/>

Increase and die in his disturbed cheeks.<br/>

Lo, when she blushed, even then did he look pale,<br/>

As if her cheeks by some enchanted power<br/>

Attracted had the cherry blood from his:<br/>

Anon, with reverent fear when she grew pale,<br/>

His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments;<br/>

But no more like her oriental red,<br/>

Than Brick to Coral or live things to dead.<br/>

Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks?<br/>

If she did blush, twas tender modest shame,<br/>

Being in the sacred presence of a King;<br/>

If he did blush, twas red immodest shame,<br/>

To veil his eyes amiss, being a king;<br/>

If she looked pale, twas silly woman's fear,<br/>

To bear her self in presence of a king;<br/>

If he looked pale, it was with guilty fear,<br/>

To dote amiss, being a mighty king.<br/>

Then, Scottish wars, farewell; I fear twill prove<br/>

A lingering English siege of peevish love.<br/>

Here comes his highness, walking all alone.<br/>

<p id="id00159">[Enter King Edward.]</p>
<p id="id00160">KING EDWARD.<br/>

She is grown more fairer far since I came hither,<br/>

Her voice more silver every word than other,<br/>

Her wit more fluent.  What a strange discourse<br/>

Unfolded she of David and his Scots!<br/>

'Even thus', quoth she, 'he spake', and then spoke broad,<br/>

With epithites and accents of the Scot,<br/>

But somewhat better than the Scot could speak:<br/>

'And thus', quoth she, and answered then her self—<br/>

For who could speak like her but she her self—<br/>

Breathes from the wall an Angel's note from Heaven<br/>

Of sweet defiance to her barbarous foes.<br/>

When she would talk of peace, me thinks, her tongue<br/>

Commanded war to prison; when of war,<br/>

It wakened Caesar from his Roman grave,<br/>

To hear war beautified by her discourse.<br/>

Wisdom is foolishness but in her tongue,<br/>

Beauty a slander but in her fair face,<br/>

There is no summer but in her cheerful looks,<br/>

Nor frosty winter but in her disdain.<br/>

I cannot blame the Scots that did besiege her,<br/>

For she is all the Treasure of our land;<br/>

But call them cowards, that they ran away,<br/>

Having so rich and fair a cause to stay.—<br/>

Art thou there, Lodowick?  Give me ink and paper.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00161">LODOWICK.<br/>

Since green our thoughts, green be the conventicle,<br/>

Where we will ease us by disburdening them.<br/>

Now, Lodowick, invocate some golden Muse,<br/>

To bring thee hither an enchanted pen,<br/>

That may for sighs set down true sighs indeed,<br/>

Talking of grief, to make thee ready groan;<br/>

And when thou writest of tears, encouch the word<br/>

Before and after with such sweet laments,<br/>

That it may raise drops in a Tartar's eye,<br/>

And make a flintheart Scythian pitiful;<br/>

For so much moving hath a Poet's pen:<br/>

Then, if thou be a Poet, move thou so,<br/>

And be enriched by thy sovereign's love.<br/>

For, if the touch of sweet concordant strings<br/>

Could force attendance in the ears of hell,<br/>

To one that shames the fair and sots the wise;<br/>

Whose bod is an abstract or a brief,<br/>

Contains each general virtue in the world.<br/>

Better than beautiful thou must begin,<br/>

Devise for fair a fairer word than fair,<br/>

And every ornament that thou wouldest praise,<br/>

Fly it a pitch above the soar of praise.<br/>

For flattery fear thou not to be convicted;<br/>

For, were thy admiration ten times more,<br/>

Ten times ten thousand more the worth exceeds<br/>

Of that thou art to praise, thy praises worth.<br/>

Begin; I will to contemplate the while:<br/>

Forget not to set down, how passionate,<br/>

How heart sick, and how full of languishment,<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00172">LODOWICK.<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00173">KING EDWARD.<br/>

What beauty else could triumph over me,<br/>

Or who but women do our love lays greet?<br/>

What, thinkest thou I did bid thee praise a horse?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00174">LODOWICK.<br/>

Of what condition or estate she is,<br/>

Twere requisite that I should know, my Lord.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00175">KING EDWARD.<br/>

Of such estate, that hers is as a throne,<br/>

And my estate the footstool where she treads:<br/>

Then maist thou judge what her condition is<br/>

By the proportion of her mightiness.<br/>

Write on, while I peruse her in my thoughts.—<br/>

Her voice to music or the nightingale—<br/>

To music every summer leaping swain<br/>

Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks;<br/>

And why should I speak of the nightingale?<br/>

The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong,<br/>

And that, compared, is too satyrical;<br/>

For sin, though sin, would not be so esteemed,<br/>

But, rather, virtue sin, sin virtue deemed.<br/>

Her hair, far softer than the silk worm's twist,<br/>

Like to a flattering glass, doth make more fair<br/>

The yellow Amber:—like a flattering glass<br/>

Comes in too soon; for, writing of her eyes,<br/>

I'll say that like a glass they catch the sun,<br/>

And thence the hot reflection doth rebound<br/>

Against the breast, and burns my heart within.<br/>

Ah, what a world of descant makes my soul<br/>

Upon this voluntary ground of love!—<br/>

Come, Lodowick, hast thou turned thy ink to gold?<br/>

If not, write but in letters Capital<br/>

My mistress' name, and it will gild thy paper:<br/>

Read, Lord, read;<br/>

Fill thou the empty hollows of mine ears<br/>

With the sweet hearing of thy poetry.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00176">LODOWICK.<br/>

I have not to a period brought her praise.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00177">KING EDWARD.<br/>

Her praise is as my love, both infinite,<br/>

Which apprehend such violent extremes,<br/>

That they disdain an ending period.<br/>

Her beauty hath no match but my affection;<br/>

Hers more than most, mine most and more than more:<br/>

Hers more to praise than tell the sea by drops,<br/>

Nay, more than drop the massy earth by sands,<br/>

And sand by sand print them in memory:<br/>

Then wherefore talkest thou of a period<br/>

To that which craves unended admiration?<br/>

Read, let us hear.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00178">LODOWICK.<br/>

'More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,'—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00179">KING EDWARD.<br/>

That line hath two faults, gross and palpable:<br/>

Comparest thou her to the pale queen of night,<br/>

Who, being set in dark, seems therefore light?<br/>

What is she, when the sun lifts up his head,<br/>

But like a fading taper, dim and dead?<br/>

My love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,<br/>

And, being unmasked, outshine the golden sun.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00180">LODOWICK.<br/>

What is the other fault, my sovereign Lord?<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00181">KING EDWARD.<br/>

</p>
<p id="id00182">LODOWICK.<br/>

'More fair and chaste'—<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00183">KING EDWARD.<br/>

I did not bid thee talk of chastity,<br/>

To ransack so the treasure of her mind;<br/>

For I had rather have her chased than chaste.<br/>

Out with the moon line, I will none of it;<br/>

And let me have her likened to the sun:<br/>

Say she hath thrice more splendour than the sun,<br/>

That her perfections emulate the sun,<br/>

That she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,<br/>

That she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,<br/>

That she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,<br/>

The she doth dazzle gazers like the sun;<br/>

And, in this application to the sun,<br/>

Bid her be free and general as the sun,<br/>

Who smiles upon the basest weed that grows<br/>

As lovingly as on the fragrant rose.<br/>

Let's see what follows that same moonlight line.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00184">LODOWICK.<br/>

'More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,<br/>

I thank thee then; thou hast done little ill,<br/>

But what is done, is passing, passing ill.<br/>

No, let the Captain talk of boisterous war,<br/>

The sick man best sets down the pangs of death,<br/>

The man that starves the sweetness of a feast,<br/>

The frozen soul the benefit of fire,<br/>

And every grief his happy opposite:<br/>

Give me the pen and paper, I will write.<br/>

<p id="id00244">Neither my daughter nor my dear friend's wife,<br/>

I am not Warwick, as thou thinkst I am,<br/>

But an attorney from the Court of hell,<br/>

That thus have housed my spirit in his form,<br/>

To do a message to thee from the king.<br/>

The mighty king of England dotes on thee:<br/>

He that hath power to take away thy life,<br/>

Hath power to take thy honor; then consent<br/>

To pawn thine honor rather than thy life:<br/>

Honor is often lost and got again,<br/>

But life, once gone, hath no recovery.<br/>

The Sun, that withers hay, doth nourish grass;<br/>

The king, that would disdain thee, will advance thee.<br/>

The Poets write that great Achilles' spear<br/>

Could heal the wound it made:  the moral is,<br/>

What mighty men misdo, they can amend.<br/>

The Lyon doth become his bloody jaws,<br/>

And grace his forragement by being mild,<br/>

When vassel fear lies trembling at his feet.<br/>

The king will in his glory hide thy shame;<br/>

And those that gaze on him to find out thee,<br/>

Will lose their eye-sight, looking in the Sun.<br/>

What can one drop of poison harm the Sea,<br/>

Whose huge vastures can digest the ill<br/>

And make it loose his operation?<br/>

The king's great name will temper thy misdeeds,<br/>

And give the bitter potion of reproach,<br/>

A sugared, sweet and most delicious taste.<br/>

Besides, it is no harm to do the thing<br/>

Which without shame could not be left undone.<br/>

Thus have I in his majesty's behalf<br/>

Appareled sin in virtuous sentences,<br/>

And dwell upon thy answer in his suit.<br/>

<p id="id00245">COUNTESS.<br/>

Unnatural besiege! woe me unhappy,<br/>

To have escaped the danger of my foes,<br/>

And to be ten times worse injured by friends!<br/>

Hath he no means to stain my honest blood,<br/>

But to corrupt the author of my blood<br/>

To be his scandalous and vile solicitor?<br/>

No marvel though the branches be then infected,<br/>

When poison hath encompassed the root:<br/>

No marvel though the leprous infant die,<br/>

When the stern dame invenometh the Dug.<br/>

Why then, give sin a passport to offend,<br/>

And youth the dangerous reign of liberty:<br/>

Blot out the strict forbidding of the law,<br/>

And cancel every cannon that prescribes<br/>

A shame for shame or penance for offence.<br/>

No, let me die, if his too boistrous will<br/>

Will have it so, before I will consent<br/>

To be an actor in his graceless lust.<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00246">WARWICK.<br/>

Why, now thou speakst as I would have thee speak:<br/>

And mark how I unsay my words again.<br/>

An honorable grave is more esteemed<br/>

Than the polluted closet of a king:<br/>

The greater man, the greater is the thing,<br/>

Be it good or bad, that he shall undertake:<br/>

An unreputed mote, flying in the Sun,<br/>

Presents a greater substance than it is:<br/>

The freshest summer's day doth soonest taint<br/>

The loathed carrion that it seems to kiss:<br/>

Deep are the blows made with a mighty Axe:<br/>

That sin doth ten times aggravate it self,<br/>

That is committed in a holy place:<br/>

An evil deed, done by authority,<br/>

Is sin and subornation:  Deck an Ape<br/>

In tissue, and the beauty of the robe<br/>

Adds but the greater scorn unto the beast.<br/>

A spatious field of reasons could I urge<br/>

Between his glory, daughter, and thy shame:<br/>

That poison shews worst in a golden cup;<br/>

Dark night seems darker by the lightning flash;<br/>

Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds;<br/>

And every glory that inclines to sin,<br/>

The shame is treble by the opposite.<br/>

So leave I with my blessing in thy bosom,<br/>

Which then convert to a most heavy curse,<br/>

When thou convertest from honor's golden name<br/>

To the black faction of bed blotting shame.<br/>

I have a prophecy, my gracious Lord,<br/>

Wherein is written what success is like<br/>

To happen us in this outrageous war;<br/>

It was delivered me at Cresses field<br/>

By one that is an aged Hermit there.<br/>

[Reads.]  'When feathered foul shall make thine army tremble,<br/>

And flint stones rise and break the battle ray,<br/>

Then think on him that doth not now dissemble;<br/>

For that shall be the hapless dreadful day:<br/>

Yet, in the end, thy foot thou shalt advance<br/>

As far in England as thy foe in France.'<br/>
</p>
<p id="id00536">KING JOHN.<br/>

By this it seems we shall be fortunate:<br/>

For as it is impossible that stones<br/>

Should ever rise and break the battle ray,<br/>

Or airy foul make men in arms to quake,<br/>

So is it like, we shall not be subdued:<br/>

Or say this might be true, yet in the end,<br/>

Since he doth promise we shall drive him hence<br/>

And forage their Country as they have done ours,<br/>

By this revenge that loss will seem the less.<br/>

But all are frivolous fancies, toys, and dreams:<br/>

Once we are sure we have ensnared the son,<br/>

Catch we the father after how we can.<br/>

Vantaged with all that heaven and earth can yield;<br/>

His party stronger battled than our whole:<br/>

His son, the braving Duke of Normandy,<br/>

Hath trimmed the Mountain on our right hand up<br/>

In shining plate, that now the aspiring hill<br/>

Shews like a silver quarry or an orb,<br/>

Aloft the which the Banners, bannarets,<br/>

And new replenished pendants cuff the air<br/>

And beat the winds, that for their gaudiness<br/>

Struggles to kiss them:  on our left hand lies<br/>

Phillip, the younger issue of the king,<br/>

Coating the other hill in such array,<br/>

That all his guilded upright pikes do seem<br/>

Straight trees of gold, the pendants leaves;<br/>

And their device of Antique heraldry,<br/>

Quartered in colours, seeming sundry fruits,<br/>

Makes it the Orchard of the Hesperides:<br/>

Behind us too the hill doth bear his height,<br/>

For like a half Moon, opening but one way,<br/>

It rounds us in; there at our backs are lodged<br/>

The fatal Crossbows, and the battle there<br/>

Is governed by the rough Chattillion.<br/>

Then thus it stands:  the valley for our flight<br/>

The king binds in; the hills on either hand<br/>

Are proudly royalized by his sons;<br/>

And on the Hill behind stands certain death<br/>

In pay and service with Chattillion.<br/>

Death's name is much more mighty than his deeds;<br/>

Thy parcelling this power hath made it more.<br/>

As many sands as these my hands can hold,<br/>

Then, all the world, and call it but a power,<br/>

Easily ta'en up, and quickly thrown away:<br/>

But if I stand to count them sand by sand,<br/>

The number would confound my memory,<br/>

And make a thousand millions of a task,<br/>

Which briefly is no more, indeed, than one.<br/>

These quarters, squadrons, and these regiments,<br/>

Before, behind us, and on either hand,<br/>

Are but a power.  When we name a man,<br/>

His hand, his foot, his head hath several strengths;<br/>

And being all but one self instant strength,<br/>

Why, all this many, Audley, is but one,<br/>

And we can call it all but one man's strength.<br/>

He that hath far to go, tells it by miles;<br/>

If he should tell the steps, it kills his heart:<br/>

The drops are infinite, that make a flood,<br/>

And yet, thou knowest, we call it but a Rain.<br/>

There is but one France, one king of France,<br/>

That France hath no more kings; and that same king<br/>

Hath but the puissant legion of one king,<br/>

And we have one:  then apprehend no odds,<br/>

For one to one is fair equality.<br/>

He was, my Lord:  and as my worthless self<br/>

With forty other serviceable knights,<br/>

Under safe conduct of the Dauphin's seal,<br/>

Did travail that way, finding him distressed,<br/>

A troop of Lances met us on the way,<br/>

Surprised, and brought us prisoners to the king,<br/>

Who, proud of this, and eager of revenge,<br/>

Commanded straight to cut off all our heads:<br/>

And surely we had died, but that the Duke,<br/>

More full of honor than his angry sire,<br/>

Procured our quick deliverance from thence;<br/>

But, ere we went, 'Salute your king', quoth he,<br/>

'Bid him provide a funeral for his son:<br/>

To day our sword shall cut his thread of life;<br/>

And, sooner than he thinks, we'll be with him,<br/>

To quittance those displeasures he hath done.'<br/>

This said, we past, not daring to reply;<br/>

Our hearts were dead, our looks diffused and wan.<br/>

Wandering, at last we climed unto a hill,<br/>

&gt;From whence, although our grief were much before,<br/>

Yet now to see the occasion with our eyes<br/>

Did thrice so much increase our heaviness:<br/>

For there, my Lord, oh, there we did descry<br/>

Down in a valley how both armies lay.<br/>

The French had cast their trenches like a ring,<br/>

And every Barricado's open front<br/>

Was thick embossed with brazen ordinance;<br/>

Here stood a battaile of ten thousand horse,<br/>

There twice as many pikes in quadrant wise,<br/>

Here Crossbows, and deadly wounding darts:<br/>

And in the midst, like to a slender point<br/>

Within the compass of the horizon,<br/>

As twere a rising bubble in the sea,<br/>

A Hasle wand amidst a wood of Pines,<br/>

Or as a bear fast chained unto a stake,<br/>

Stood famous Edward, still expecting when<br/>

Those dogs of France would fasten on his flesh.<br/>

Anon the death procuring knell begins:<br/>

Off go the Cannons, that with trembling noise<br/>

Did shake the very Mountain where they stood;<br/>

Then sound the Trumpets' clangor in the air,<br/>

The battles join:  and, when we could no more<br/>

Discern the difference twixt the friend and foe,<br/>

So intricate the dark confusion was,<br/>

Away we turned our watery eyes with sighs,<br/>

As black as powder fuming into smoke.<br/>

And thus, I fear, unhappy have I told<br/>

Shall mourners be, and weep out bloody tears,<br/>

Until their empty veins be dry and sere:<br/>

The pillars of his hearse shall be his bones;<br/>

The mould that covers him, their City ashes;<br/>

His knell, the groaning cries of dying men;<br/>
